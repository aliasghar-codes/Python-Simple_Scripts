num = int(input("Enter the number: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, num+1):
    sum = sum + i
print(f"The sum of first n natural number is {sum}")

# Same as above program but the difference is that here excep multiply i use plus b'cos here i need sum which means plus and the second difference is in initial value of sum which is 0 in above program i use 1 b'cos that was multiplying and if i use 0 in it the whole value will multiply with 0 and answer will become 0 that's why i use 1 but here i am using 0 b'cos if i use 1 then the initial value 1 will also be add in our required answer which will become false answer.
